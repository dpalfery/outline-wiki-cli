Stop! Ask user for the following inputs before proceding
- task-document: the location of the doucment with the list of tasks 
- requirements-document: a document with all the requirements in EARS format
- design-document: a document with the architecture to be followed
review the <requirements-document> and the <design-document> to fully understand the goal and endstate of the solution. Then review the <tasks-document> document and complette all tasks, work autonomously without input from the user, work on one task at a time marking tasks as complete by adding an x between the [ ] infront of the task number when you complete them. create a antigravity.status.md file in the root and update it with your completions notes for each task. Be sure to review all the markdown files in the solution for context prioritizing information from the 6-Docs folder and ignoring docs in the 6-Docs/archive folder. a task is not complete until the acceptance criteria associated with the tasks matches the output of the task, acceptance criteria associated with the task is found in the <requirements-document>. Review the completed tasks to ensure they match the acceptance criteria and ensure the new tasks meet it as well.
